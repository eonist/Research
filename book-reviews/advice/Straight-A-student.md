## Straight A student
 
The intro talks about how the book separates from other study guide books, that it's made from the students point of view, and that it's not about about brute force studying by sacrificing sleep or recreational time. Cramming in all nighters etc.
 
**Pseudo working**
Many students think they do real work by studying 8 hours straight, bring red bulls to all night readings right before exams etc. Non ground straight a students avoid pseudo working at all cost
 
**Time management**
Having a realistic sense of time is arguably the most important trait you can have as a student. Schedule tasks from a calendar in the morning leave plenty of time for breaks 1 hour not a stressful 20min one. Keep the time slots less than 1,5 hours group many smaller tasks into one time-slot, and quit well before bedtime to have time to relax and unwind. The brain needs breaks to perform at peak. All this to avoid all nighters and sub par performance at crucial times. Timetabling your tasks will also help avoid procrastinating.
 
**Handwritten todo of the day**
Keep a small piece of paper with the task of the day and time slots to complete them, also keep a things to remember section. The next morning transfer the remaining tasks and ps. Things to your calendar.
 
**Food**
Drink often, breaks to the bathroom only gives your body variation from sitting still.
Eat healthy, fruits veggies, nuts, avoid sugar that gives you a short burst of energy
Avoid too much caffeinated drinks
Eat regularly to avoid low energy periods
 
**Procrastination**
There will be a few days where you have to pull all day marathons to just grind through an assignment. It's important that these days are planned and not a result of procrastination.
 
**When to study**
Short burst of 45 min  to 1.5h. If you have an empty pocket of time pull out a continuous study and read it.
 
**Where to study**
In isolation, find spots that are calm and empty.
 
**How much time to spend**
For maximum retention spend 40- 50 min
There are people that devote their entire life to the grind
If you cut class it will take twice as much time studying to catch up on the missed class
 
**Note taking**
Non tech classes revolve around three things. Question, evidence and conclusion. It's all about the big ideas surrounding different subjects.
Structure what the professor says in class the same way. You can't write down all he says anyway. Review your notes after class. To further cement the lecture to your mind.
Technical classes needs detailed note taking also ask questions or make question marks on stuff that is unclear
 
**Reading everything is impossible**, figuring out what is most important is the tricky part
Reading that makes an argument is more important than reading that is about a person or an event which is. More important than reading that provides context.
But most importantly is reading favored sources reading material that shows up frequently or is underlined by a Ã¥rpffessor.
 
**Favored sources**
If it's hard to determine what the favoured source is look at the title of the class, the favored sources should have related names to the subject. The favored sources will also be close to what the teacher emphasizes in class. Un favored sources can be skimmed with some additional note taking on imp parts.
 
**Note taking on favored sources**
Can be distilled into three parts a question, evidence, and conclusion. The question can usually be found in the title or the first few sentences. Next look for the author's conclusion thesis statement, this is perhaps the most difficult part because authors like complexity in their conclusion. It's usually hidden in the first few paragraphs or the last few paragraphs where its more refined after all the evidence supporting the conclusion.
 
**Technical problem sets**
Solve it by first spending a small chunk of time on it to familiarize yourself with it then, let it rest if it's to hard to solve straight away. Problems that are creative of nature are seldom solved by brute force and big time slots. Let the problem simmer in between other activities. When it comes to you write the whole thing down perfectly. 
 
**Define the challenge**
What material seems to be key to the exam.
What type of questions will be asked (earlier exams can help answer this)
Will texh exams allow formulas
Will it be an open not or book exam
How much time and will it be challenging or normal
 
Previews exams are great for reviewing your skill level. They are also great for distilling out the favoured sources.
 
**Memorization**
Simply use flashcards, problem on one side answer on the other. Memorie one or two hours max per day. And spread the memorization period out. Don't memorize for  8 hours straight, it won't stick.
 
Don't organize and study on the same day
 
**Imprinting knowledge**
For tech courses : The best way to imprint knowledge is to review it and then try to explain and reproduce it in your own words or in writing (unaided) after this is complete the knowledge is not going anywhere
Non tech courses: use the quiz and recall method here aswell you have formatted your notes on all the source material in question evidence conclusion so just try to reproduce the big ideas out loud or in writing. If you stumble upon things you can't reproduce make a mark of it and review your notes and then reproduce that single part. 
 
**No clue questions on the exams** (academic disaster assurance)
They happen, but they can be tackled by making all the obscure questions that arose throughout the semester answered when they show up, and make use of the pre exam review session often offered. 
 
 
**On the exam**
Divide your time on number of questions minus 10min use the extra ten min here and there double checking your answers. Review all the questions in. 5 min. Start with the easiest questions first, skip any questions that doesn't come to you right away. And return to it later
 
**Exam questions**
Usually you can distill 3 or 4 mini questions from a single exam question, write down and underline this questions, use the margins on the exam paper to outline in points what you know of these questions. Number the points in the order you want to present them in your essay. After exam completion and you still have time recheck your work. Many times there will be a small mistake in tech courses for instance. Tech exams are usually graded on a curve so top 15 % gets an A, staying cool ons harder than usual questions is key.since everyone else also will find this question tricky.
 
**Writing an essay or paper**
Divide it into 3 parts, sifting through existing arguments, forming your own argument, communicating your arguments clearly
 
**Right mindset**
To put yourself in the right mindset pick up Atlantic Monthly, New Yorker or Harper's, read some high level articles and absorb some writers skills,(good one)
 
**Separate writing processes**
Separate the research part 2 days worth, and writing part 2 days worth, and editing part 2 days worth. The idea here is that by finishing the research part first you won't have to constantly go back to your sources and research again. And you will have a deep understanding of the topic. In contrast to many other student does this by doing a 1 week research writing frenzy. Ending in sleep deprivation and bleary eyes.
 
**Editing**
When editing a paper, run many passes over it a vocal reading pass, spellprofing pass argument adjustment pass
 
**Split efforts into chunks**
Researching for 8 hours straight will yield half the result as 4 chunks of 2 hour research. Separate reading from thinking and thinking from writing.
 
**Study and work in isolation.**
The importance of quiet and working in Isolation is repeat more than 20 times.
It seems to be the key to super concentration. Will this translate to a real college situation or even the workplace later in life. Possibly this they key to most things effective, also regularly switching the isolation nook, so not to feel lonely. Cubicles forbid.
 
**Pro**
This study guide book is based around the fact that long study sessions should be avoided at all cost, short incremental bursts of studying will keep your mind energy at peak. And a positive byproduct of this burst type of studying is that you keep a lot of material simmering in your head, overtime forging a strong bond since you think about it more often than not. The book has many good instructions and includes examples of in use situations.
 
**Con**
Efficiency is good but in the future efficient grinding will be the norm, if you want be stand out, you probably need to have excessive empathic, creative and engineering abilities combined with efficient grinding. Since all slabs of efficiency  in our society will be rare.
 
**Conclusion**
All in all i think the way this books teaches you how to study enables you to be happy, no all nighters that zaps moral and motivation, planning generates a sense of control, and eating right and working out makes your body healthy.
