Atlas shrugged


Uses a lot of the same similar advance words like gayety, shrugged, etc

Most fictional stories in this world portrays the world with evil right winged villains who owns too much and despises the lay man, in atlas shrugged this is flipped and its the left side pf politics that is the villains. Sneaky, conivng , deciting villans that only car about the people and that none should be able to own or have any ability better than others. And the right side is criminalozed and depocted as egocentric.

The book is a nice catalysator for thinking outside the norm of your own political domain. Since its so pf pivot. Its hard to agree with the extreme socialism enforced by the story's villans but at the same time its hard too agree withe the right wingged hetos of the story too, since you sort of know that if given the chance they to would rule with limitless sceuteny of their opposition.

In my opinion its a nice political thought experiment, and makes you think long and hard about left vs right. Is there ever an equilibrium? 

**Pro**
Provokes new thought
