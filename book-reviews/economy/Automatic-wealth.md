I’m not recommending getting into a crowded market with a weak, copycat product. But your chances of success doing that would be much greater than trying to create a new market with an untested product. When it comes to launching a new product, a very good position to take is second or third place. The marketability is proven with the first success. By coming in second or third, you reduce your risk while still enjoying the momentum that the first product may have created in the marketplace. But even if you are fourth, fifth, or tenth into the market, you can still be successful so long as you price your product competitively, sell it forcefully, and develop its own peculiar benefits to distinguish it from the competition.

Forget Retail and Glamour Businesses We can make this section very short. If your idea for a side business involves a retail store or just about any business you think is glamorous (travel and entertainment are the two biggest culprits), save your money. Retail businesses can succeed, but they are very difficult and very time-consuming, and they almost never provide the ROI you want from them. Travel and entertainment businesses are even worse. If you are already in one of these businesses, you know what I’m talking about. If you aren’t, take my word for it. You’ll be glad you did.
