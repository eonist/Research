Herecomes everybody

Simple vs complex
Gabrial richards from snmicrosystems once wrote worse is better 
The point was that a simple butakward programming language is better than a elegant and complex one because the simple one will be used by many more people and thus being improved more rapidly.

Transaction cost 
The concept of transaction cost is ie when gathering people is harder the transaction cost is high when its low ie on facebook starting a pro anorexia group the the liklyhood of that happening is also low.

On importance of simplicity
A dev company were making an advance project managing tool, but they needed to manage the project so they made a really simple one to use while making the advance one. It was just insert text on a website, newst comes at the top. It turned out that they dropped the advance project managing tool and just continued working on the simple one. It later became blogger.com


No whining
Winprog is and age old irc chanell for the best windows programers one of its core rules is no whining. The no whining rule is a good rule of thumb in any gathering

Outfailing
The concept of outfailing your competitors is as important as outcompeting competitors. Most opensource projects fail, but the once that succesed tend to be better than propriotary spftware because any given firm cant expeiriment as much as opensource and thus becuase of money cant fail as often. Failure is a key factor in succeding
They dont creat biases in favor of predictable but substandard outxomes.

Steady performers vs briliant but erratic
Jhonathan ive at apple can be called a briliant but erratic performer. Stuck in a basement at apple making strange clay models that had no real future. Then discovered by steve jobs that isolated him im in greenhouse with harware tools to explore further. Isolated fro. The rest of the company in an utopian world of exploration. But companis cant afford brilliant but eratic and there for steady performers are hired which in turn yields predictable but sub standard outcomes.

Pro
Ezplaiks why opensource is important both for and against and that both propirotarty and open source can live in harmoney and theyr weaknesses and strengths.

Con
The book is sort of like many nyt and wired articles in a row with a red string connecting them. Always back logging points like any given comedian.

The books is basically extraction of other preciouse books, at the end of the bok there is about 20 pages of bibliografy pointing to this work. What ever happned to having once own ideas?
