The Shallows

The part about schemas is interesting. 
The part about deep reading is good. How we become good at reading the web and playing crosswords at the same time. 
The argument that we become less able to solve deep problems when we expose our self s to all the information we obtain on the web. Because we split our attention all the time and when we sit down and try to read a long book our mind easily drifts because we coknstantly looking for hyper links and easy information. We become good at multitasking sur. But at the same time we lose our ability to solve original problems.

The part that argues that we need to take break from long problem solving sesions is also good, yoku wont solve the problem that you cant get past by throwijng more tired hours on it. Rather take a break and as we say "sleep on it" twking a tea break can reset your mind and solve the problem when you return to it.

Following blogs and peaple sucking in "usefull "information. Everyday doesnt rewlly seperate yoku from the crokwd , because everybody els is also following the same things. But by distanse youself from this infostream and solving and discovereing orilginsl prolems your self will then result in this informwtion beingj xommited to your personal schema of knowlege.
