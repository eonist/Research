Free by Criss anderson


Good book, talks mostly about past and present and doesnt really spark any new ideas on how the future of free will look, just that it will be an extension of the current just more extreme, and thats not really too hard to predict.

It argues the case why free is good in length but doent really explore the negatives , like mass unemployment of non super experts. Yes free will enable othr income revenues but you would have to be incridible smart and very few can create this alteenate revenue strreams. Margins will be so tight that few can enable it. And in consequence lack of competent product will be made. If the is no motivation for people to create techological evolution thenit will stagnate. Like communism free will level out progress for lack of motivation. Why would anyone create something new if it doesnt make any money. The book argues other motivational factors like rspect ion the community. Etc. Kind of like communism advocated community spirit. That didnt turn out too well did it, east geermsny, russia, latvia, north korea etc

The authr lists 50 ways that free is good in the end of the book, i uggest you read thouse to see why free cant be the eveloution of comerse. I belive the evolution is something els. Ideas so hard to hurn out that they cant jut be recreated.

Also why doesnt the auther explore the future of brands and its importance to charge more. I beleie the future is not free but maybe ha something to do with brands and elit iddeas and tchology. I guess naono tech and also the iportane of sustwinable food produce. In the end all  techonlogy nano, energy h3, food scarsidy selfsustainable local robotic greenhousesand politics /poverty will be solved as a result and the main goal eill be to live harmononuse eat grapes and drink wine. The. Everything will be free, but until then it shouldnt be, 

Or maybe the future is to have a few experts leading the sheep and alot of no brainers consuming and just existing being unable to shift anything. Kind of like it is today.
