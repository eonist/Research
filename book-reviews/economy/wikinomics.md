Wikinomics

Summary
Discusses effects of business transitioning into the post industrial era where crowd sourcing thrives, mostly around the positice effects. Its an unbiased book

The book is like an open-source project with all its flaws, no clear architecture, naivly built, naivly argumented has a very utopian look on crowd sourcing, very unbiased

Only makes the connection to Communism once and just as a comment.


Pro
Has some good points on why using third party r & d but doest argue why reinventing the wheel is key to development
