**Summary**   
Keep code simple. Big systems should have signle purpose classes with functions no more than 5 - 7 lines. Which also makes it reusable in other projects. Simple responsibilities and simplpe relationships with other parts in the system  
Many incremental changes are better than one massive.   
Similar code shouldn't always be shared among classes, create with less dependencies in mind.  
Always clean code that looks dirty, refractor 1 long function into two small etc  
Deliberate practise for 10.000 hours or 20 hours a day for 10years to become expert.   
Completing a task is not deliberate practise, completing a task to improve your performance is.  
Don't be a fraid to break things. Refactor copy pasted code and move stuff around Rename if needed.  
Don't have all logic in a manager allocate method logic to the type classes  
Bug report , how the bug happened, what should happen, what happened closed and open state. Priority  
Learn your ide , learn all shortcuts this saves time  
Just because problem is hard to doesn't menan your code should be hard to inturprate  
Use polymorphism instead of some if else procedures  
Put everything under version contol  
Reinvent the wheel is as essential for a programmer as lifting weights is for a body builder  
Code in the domain you working in I.e
