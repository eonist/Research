Implement activites
-Testtheqctivitiesto make sure the systemsatisfies the requirements
-Deployment activite s to make the system avaiable to its users

When using an itterative process to build a system we should apply Use case, architecture and riskmanagment.

- Usecase diagrams is an exelent way to map out what the system should do from the users. Point of view.
- Architecture is the glue between the elements that makes up the system
- risk managment is the process of ,apping out hindrances, like unstable technologies, new team members, or hard implementwtion, unstable databases etc

Class diagrams often have short pointer descriptions
