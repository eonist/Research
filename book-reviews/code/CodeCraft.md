**Codecraft**  
  
Initialize variables when you define them  
Make as many variables as you can Constants because it prevents you from modify data that is off limit.  
Good codeers think carefully abot the code they write as they write it  
Avoid data, object, value and type in naming, dont use temp unless you really need it  
Be varey of names that sound similar  
When naming balance length, clearity, context  
Intead of IStylable   
If a value cant be negative use a unsigned int  
Never set variables to a numer use constant same goes for strings  
Set public methods before private methods  
Add a header wite a description of the class Purpose: clear cache  
Add purpose to the method commenting  
 Dont return nonsensicall error, present the errer in its contex  
Set you ide commen text to green to accosiate positivness with comments  
When writing comments ask why, not how  
Work enough not hard  
Breakwater comments are good to navigate around code  
//xxx indicade kludge  
Use assertion functions to determin if inputdata to ensure you have been given correct and consistent data.  
Check all input from external sources for validity before use  
STrive for Sese single entry single exit  
Use try catch when checking for error in run code  
Tuple is when you return an object wide data and error message  
Code metrics: A high cyclomatic complexity implies that the code is uninteligable and considering the amount of decision points and potental flow of control  
  
**Con**  
Negative attitude to code,   
Way to long and repetive  
Advices contridict each other  
Just another feel good book that actually dont make you feel good  
  
  
Pro first 200 pages is ok, rest is just summay from other books and doesnt say anythimg new
