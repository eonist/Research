If the name apears frequently inthe engkish domain of the problem then its a good naming abstraction  
Its beter to push data into an object than it is to use a gettermethod to pull out some information  
The maintainability of a program is inversly proportional to the amount of data that flows between objects  
Inheritance has maintenqnce problems, intereface implementation is more flexible,because when you change a base class in a inheritance   base relationship you risk breaking the derived classes ehen base class is changed
Ekstra lines of code is a trivial price to pay for eliminating the fragile state og using a base class  
Apply the 80/20 rule to classes. Create clases that serve 80 % of the cases rather then supportthe last super user 20% cases  
Use extend with care  

Dont create a huge monster uml diagram, create small chunks of diagrams and use oo design process first  
 Use itterator class with collections because then you can easily swap out databases  
Ive found that when you try to understand an application rather than designing it its best to draw up a static uml model
