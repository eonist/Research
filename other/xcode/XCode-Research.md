**Organizing source code:**
1. Start by dragging in a src folder from finder to xcode "file-treeview"
2. When prompted: Check "create groups"  
3. Any file you add will now be placed in the corresponding folder in finder 
4. Create subfolders by right clicking treeview and selecting "New Group" 
5. In the subsequent file prompt add a folder by the same name as your group.  
6. Use finder if you need to move folders and files around. Delete the root in xcode and drag in the src folder. The groups will now represent the reorganized file structure.  

**Remove the copyright text in new .swift files** (you may need to do it after every xcode update)
Remove all text here: 

**folder** :  
"~/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Source/Swift\ File.xctemplate" 
**file** :   
"File.xctemplate/___FILEBASENAME___.swift"
