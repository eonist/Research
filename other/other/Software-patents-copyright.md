## **A research paper concerning software patents**
> By Eonist (André J)

**Hardware vs software patenting dilemma:**
If you possess the hardware, it is trivial to reengineer it, alas we need patents that protect the commodity from becoming only worth its production cost. An in turn yield no leftover funding for further R & D. On the other hand if you possess software and it is encrypted, one can not trivially reengineer it. Because one can not reengineer what one can not see. What is left is only the business process, and business processes can not, and should not be applicable for patents. And one can not sue someone else for something one can not see or have legal access to examine. Only the business process is left. And again that is not patentable under current law. (See source for this at the bottom of this research paper, under the section business process patents)

Also try to imagine if you invented an A.I software that could answer the question of what life is about, to make this invention applicable for a patent, you would have to disclose how the invention works (this is a must within hardware patents) the minute you reveal to your competitors how your invention works they will start copying you behind closed doors. And you will not be able to see if they stole your algorithms because they will be hidden behind cryptography. Your competitors could simple proclaim that their invention is original and not based on your work, and you would not be able legally to examine their work under current law. And if the law changed (highly unlikely) to allow examination then the same examination would allow theft.
 
**Software is math**    
A program is the transcription of an algorithm in a programming language, and being every (Turing-complete) programming language equivalent to Church's lambda calculus by virtue of the Church-Turing thesis, a program is thus the transcription of a mathematical function. Since math is not patentable, neither is software.[6

**Copyright**    
It is argued that traditional copyright has provided sufficient protection to facilitate massive investment in software development.[13]
Copyright is the right of an author(s) to prevent others from copying their creative work without a license. Thus the author of a particular piece of software can sue someone that copies that software without a license. Copyright protection is given automatically and immediately without the need to register the copyright with a government, although...

**Business methods are not patentable:**
The business method cases make the critical legal point that computerized versions of established processes should not be patentable. Simply making a calculation or other process faster and more efficient is not enough. Instead, the computerized process must be solving a technological or other tangible problem.

**trivial patents**
Anecdotal evidence suggests that some software patents cover either trivial inventions or inventions that would have been obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.[15]


**Hinders research and development**
Some scientific studies and expert reviews have concluded that patent systems paradoxically hinder technological progress[8] and allows monopolies and powerful companies

**Monopolies ideas**
To accept that a functionality of a computer program can be protected as such would amount to making it possible to monopolies ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development.
The context is that a company tried to claim ownership of certain software features via copyright, so “as such“, here, refers to the use of copyright. Now, if the same monopoly was sought through patents, the only difference would be that instead of lasting fifty or seventy years, it would last only twenty. Twenty years is an eternity in software development, so software problems that would exist under copyright-based monopolies would also exist under patent-based monopolies.

It seems likely then that the Advocates-General would also find patent-based software idea monopolies detrimental to technological progress and industrial development. Good to know we might have an ally there.




One aspect of the debate has focused on the proposed European Union directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, also known as the "CII Directive" or the "Software Patent Directive," which was ultimately **rejected by the EU Parliament in July 2005.**



**the problem with disclosure:**
A patent must publicly disclose the invention. This could educate the public by making them aware of a previously unknown or not obvious software invention. this would in turn make it possible for anyone to copy the software and then sell it as their own encrypted. No one would know how it did what it did, and it would be impossible to prove, unless you can see the code. 



**The locked box problem.** 
you cannot prove something you cannot see. Software is invisible. Only the business process is visible.


**The aftermath after Bilski  v. Kappos  and Alice v. CLS Bank.:**
Once upon a time this was how many software and business method patents were written, many by attorneys and agents who did not specialize in software or computers. This type of vague patent description will not lead to a patent eligible invention after the Supreme Court’s decisions in  Bilski v. Kappos and Alice v. CLS Bank.

- Since the Supreme Court decided Bilski, the machine-or-transformation test has become the de facto test for patent eligibility; a safe harbor. If you satisfy the machine-or-transformation test then you have a patentable invention.  Failure to satisfy the machine-or-transformation test and you may have a patentable invention, but there is not yet an example of a computer related process that failed the machine-or transformation test and was found to be patentable. Given this reality let’s focus on the machine-prong of the test, which asks whether the claimed process is tied to a particular machine or apparatus.

These patents are typically characterized as business method patents, and today these types of broad patents are difficult, if not impossible to obtain.

**The hardware with software dilemma:**
The only part of a Specification: A driverless car patent should be thought of as an auto industry patent, but not as a software patent even though the patent application might contain lots and lots of innovative software descriptions in the Specification. The famous Artificial Retina patent is a medical device patent that contains some standard (obvious) software to analyze video frames from a camera so that those images can be transferred to the brain. So although that software is mentioned in the Specification, that software was not the inventive part of invention and was not described in any detail in the disclosure of the Artificial Retina invention. If one examines Robotic inventions most, if not all recent robotic inventions, have a software component in the Specifications. But that is no reason to call a robotic patent a software patent.

**Software has never been classified in the 474 classes of patents and over 160,000 sub-classes.**
The author went on to add that federal trial courts have rejected software patents in nine cases and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected software patents in three others. The author then states that “Justice Clarence Thomas who wrote June’s high-court opinion, said that for a software patent to be valid, it must describe more than an old idea simply applied to a computer”.
Over the years the patent office categorized patents into various classes and sub-classes. Currently the US Patent office classifies patents using the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) which was jointly developed by the European Patent Office and the USPTO. Software has never been classified in the 474 classes of patents and over 160,000 sub-classes. (citation or source needed here) But software can be a very important part, or all, of a Specification in a patent application. Conversely, the software described in the patent application may be very obvious and not be the inventive part of the Specification. Let’s look at the two possibilities….

**Cost of production** (new)
The only reason hardware is patentable is to avoid it becoming copied endlessly and becoming only worth the price of the material its built with. Software on the other hand doesn't have this problem, since the price of its material is already free. Then the price one can take for software will be the same as the price it takes to support its maintenance, and keeping up with its competition. One may argue that other people can steal their software idea. Yes, this is true, but first they would have to build it, this may prove to be impossible if secret proprietary algorithms are used etc, and have enough money to stay afloat while building it, and then make sure that they can support its maintenance, they also have to get customers who don't really like buying copy-cats in the first place. If one has the ingenuity and resources to do all this, they probably wouldn't do it in the first place, they rather use their time on building something original.

**Revealing your patent** (new)
All hardware patents rely on showing the world how you did it. There must be a thorough description and schematic how it works so that the world as a whole can benefit from your invention, and new inventions can spur in light of this. Not just the owner of the patent. This doesn't work for software, as a big part of staying competitive within software is to have secret proprietary algorithms that don't lend them selfs to being easy to reengineer.




- [ ] Write about why OpenSourcing your work is smart. So that in the future you have a timeline so that if someone in a few years gets a software patent then you can fight this patent by showing evidence that this piece of software was invented before and is now obvious and cant be patented. 


Trademark doesn't protect an idea in the same way that everyone has the right to write a horror novel about an abandoned winter hotel. but no one can copy Stephen kings the shining word for word. (Infinite monkey theorem): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem


- Change is happening now. The 2008 ruling of the appeals court of the US Federal Circuit on the case in re Bilski narrowed the scope of what is patentable. Some experts even question if software patents are still valid at all in the US. ESP, under the direction of Ben Klemens, played a key role in this case. See our resources for lawyers page for details.

- How can a complain-tif sue a software if the software is invisible to the complain-tif

- Worse, he then suggests giving more resources to the patent office and giving it the additional power to hear patent infringement cases. The patent office has a financial interest in granting as many patents as possible, so increasing their resources would probably result in an increase in patents granted. Giving the patent office the competence to hear infringement cases would mean that disputed patents would be reviewed by the same biased organization that granted them in the first place. This would be disastrous. (link needed?)

**Hardware vs software patents discussion points:**
- This allows us to tie the processes directed by the computer (i.e., software) to tangible items that have always been patentable.

- There is a significant advantage to describe the underlying technology, hardware, data structures and communications technology. This is because the more you make something look like other things that have long been patentable the better your chances are of convincing someone, like a judge down the road, that what you have is a true invention because there are pieces and parts that can be identified and touched.

- Furthermore, by spending time to discuss tangible applications that utilize tangible components you may be able to nudge your patent application out of an Art Unit that deals with pure software and into an Art Unit that deals with the tangible components.

- Simply describing a vague and amorphous set of process steps can and will lead to broad claims, but claims that will almost certainly overlap with at least something in the prior art, or which will simply be patent ineligible. 


- I believe this is why software patents have been so maligned, because when they simply talk of “accepting data, processing data, outputting data” the process steps lack the typical concrete explanation required in a patent application

- will require ingenuity or first-of-its-kind development.


- [ ] Some books with algorithms try to patent their examples. find StackOverflow discussion on this, this often leads the developer to obfuscate the algo in order to not get bothered by the author etc.
