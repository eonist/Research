## **Network collaboration**  
**The antidote to all current institutionalized work:**  
 
Pursue network collaboration rather than institutionalized work. I've been researching a few books on the matter the last couple of years like: Clay Sharky "here comes everybody" T. L FriedMan "The world is flat" and Rework and Remote from 37signals (basecamp) as well as numerous others on the subject. My current thinking is that most institutions hasn't kept up with the pace of technology, and are often too rooted in old ways of doing things. Bluntly put: You end up spending more time on strategizing against your collogues than actually solving problems with them. Example: your PM asks how long it takes to complete feature A. You say 1 week, she says ok. Then it doesn't take 1 week but 2. Now you are looking at a lot of late nights or all the blame or both. So by default you should say 2 weeks. Now you strategizing. Creative work is extremely volatile, sometimes things take no time at all, other times they take a while. Administration still think of creative work as a linear thing. Anyway you see were this is going.

**The question that remains to be solved:**  
How can individuals spontaneously come together with no barriers and pursue ideas with intrinsic motivation? The idea: "things i could do if i could clone my self 10 times". The problem I've found is trust, diverging interests and greed hold most pursuits like this from happening.

Note to self rewrite this with a more positive spin


Next LifeTheory blog post will be about how to "Petition" for things in a collective. A flat structure collective os not a democracy, its not a dictatorship. Technocracy would be close. But rather you let the best ideas win. You let the most sound arguments win. Smart people are not stubborn they give in to a better idea.
